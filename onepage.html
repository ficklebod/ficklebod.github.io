  <h1>Is this some kind of test? Yes!</h1>
  <p>MyBuilder is one big happy family, and this assessment will help us determine if your DNA is a match.</p>
<p>We’ll be asking you to demonstrate your customer service skills, explain your thought processes and give you plenty of opportunity to show off your creativity and personality. It should take roughly an hour to complete and will end with an evaluation of your typing speed. 
  </p>
<p>Grab a mug of your favourite beverage, sharpen your pencil, get yourself ready, set your nerves to steady and we hope you find it enjoyable.</p>
<button class="button" type="submit">Got my cuppa!</button>
  <h1>Before you begin...</h1>
  <p>We want to get an idea of how long it takes you to ponder on and then answer each question. So, don't tell us you're ready until you are going to go through it all. </p>
  <p>We don't want you to rush though, a good answer is better than a fast answer. Just hold off going to refill your cuppa until you've got through all the questions.

  <h1>Oh dear. Write a response to this complaint</h1>
  <p>I hired one of your tradespeople to give my garden the once over, just weeding and mowing and some other little bits and bobs. He charged me £200 for two days work. My neighbour has the same sized garden as me and her gardener only charged £180. I’m deaf and I can’t help thinking this rogue has taken advantage of me. I’ve been ripped off, I’m not happy and I want this person banned from ever using your website again!!
  </p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Mr A. Noid

  <h1>Refund or reject?</h1>
  <p>MyBuilder doesn’t provide refunds. A roofer paid £500 on materials for a job which was then cancelled. We invoiced them £18 for the contact details which they’re refusing to pay and will badmouth us across social media unless we waive the fee. They’ve been with us for years and they regularly complain. Do you grant them a refund of reject their request?

  <h1>Reply to this TrustPilot review</h1>
  <p class="bold">Imagine you are the Head of PR at Banana Brothers Fun Fair.</p>
  <p>I am thoroughly disgusted by my experience at Banana Brothers. The ‘so called’ candy floss wasn’t flossy enough and dissolved in the rain, the clowns terrified my children, and after the rollercoaster my Grandfather couldn’t walk straight. The cuddly toy I won on the Hook-a-Duck wasn’t cuddly, and the hot dogs were tepid at best. The fortune teller told me that I was destined for good luck, and shortly afterwards my son fell out of the bumper cars. Having never been to a fun fair before, I am extremely unlikely ever to go again.</p>
