  <p class="bold">Imagine you are the Head of PR at Banana Brothers Fun Fair.</p>
  <p>I am thoroughly disgusted by my experience at Banana Brothers. The ‘so called’ candy floss wasn’t flossy enough and dissolved in the rain, the clowns terrified my children, and after the rollercoaster my Grandfather couldn’t walk straight. The cuddly toy I won on the Hook-a-Duck wasn’t cuddly, and the hot dogs were tepid at best. The fortune teller told me that I was destined for good luck, and shortly afterwards my son fell out of the bumper cars. Having never been to a fun fair before, I am extremely unlikely ever to go again.</p>
