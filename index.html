<h1>Hourly running intervals: round 2</h1>
  <p>Today mike and I will do 2 mile loops every hour for 15 hours. It's 7.52, he's done 3 loops already. At 9 Vicky will be joining for 1 mile loops for 12 hours. I'll need to keep going 3 hours after they've finished to catch up</p>
  <p>My only tasks for today are as follows
    <ul>
      <li>do 10 press ups and 10 crunches/sit ups after each loop. [edit. was down to 5, after back spasm in loop3 , might just give these a rest for a few loops at least</li>
      <li>Build a webpage that can run a functional bingo number generator personalised for MyBuilder, and make it look good. Or at least respectable</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>08.41 - first lap done, was a bit uncomfortable, panting most of it. And the hill at the end, or incline rather, doesn't seem sustainable for the whole time</p>
<p>also, inlets (Mike says that's what they might be called) are all but knackered now so had to bore some proper lace holes.</p>
<p>Thoughts going round:
  <ul>
    <li> could I do this for the full 24 hours this time round? Probably not</li>
    <li>I should probably aim to do 10min/miles from the beginning</li>
    <li>Maybe 5 press ups and 5 crunches is more sustainable</li>
    <li>I wonder how long it would take to get to doing 50miles at 8mm as a non stop run</li>
    <li>I wonder what the incline is on the last stretch</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>I had to copy/paste the random number generator code but I understand it all enough to replicate except for line 7 where I still haven't got my head around "* (i+1)"<br>
I can randomise a list of number, then pull out the first number in that list and print the relevant bingo call to the screen.<br>Now though, I'm a bit stuck on how I pull the second number from the randomised list...<br>Best guess at the moment is  to have line 43 as the function to call upon the pressing of a button. But seeing as I didn't really retain much of the HTML from freecodecamp, I need to refresh my mind.<br>Edit: now to the top of the page to start building that form...It is 09:54</p>
